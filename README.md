# Codex

This repository contains example machine learning notebooks.

## Contents

- `iris_pytorch.ipynb`: Train and evaluate a neural network classifier for the Iris dataset using PyTorch.

## Usage

Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook and run the cells sequentially. The notebook downloads the Iris dataset from `scikit-learn`, preprocesses it, and trains a simple feed-forward neural network with PyTorch.
